                <li>Establishing an inclusive and collaborative environment that encourages team members to ask 
                    questions and seek assistance when needed</li>
                <li>Performing functional tests, regression testing, and end-to-end testing to ensure the product's 
                    quality and reliability.</li>

                    acceptance criteria to meet the client's expectations.</li>

                    exceptional analytical, research, and presentation skills.</li>

                    objectives.</li>
